An HDMI signal converter backpack

A circuit I designed for my electrical/computer engineering senior design project. Takes up to 1080p HDMI video signals, feeds them to a TI TFP401A signal converter, and directly drives an attached LCD. Also provides capacitive touch sensing, backlight control, and DDC data.

A few months later a similar product appeared for sale on Adafruit (#2219). Much easier to just buy theirs than to try to hand solder the TFP401A under a microscope like I did...
